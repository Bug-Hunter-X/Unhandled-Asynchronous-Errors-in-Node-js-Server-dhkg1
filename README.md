# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers: improper handling of errors within asynchronous operations. The server simulates an asynchronous task that randomly succeeds or fails.  The original code lacks proper error handling, leading to inconsistent responses.

The solution shows how to handle such errors using `try...catch` blocks and promises or async/await to ensure that the server always responds appropriately, even when errors occur. This robust handling improves the server's reliability and provides better feedback to clients.
